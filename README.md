# Project: Up-Rugby

## Introduction
After having successfully completed the Ironhack Wed Developement Bootcamp, I wanted to keep praticing and learning new things while I was applying for job position in the meantime.

For project I decided to usethe following technologies: 
- Next JS,
- MongoDB & Mongoose, 
- Axios,

## Pitch

Up-rugby is an educational content platform for rugby players, coaches and fans. There is both free and paid content.</br>
A friend of mine created the whole content and has a wordpress version of the application.
As the <a href="https://www.up-rugby.fr/">current version</a> doesn't look that great and the perfomance should be improve, my friend ask me to redesign it.

Here started the journey!!
